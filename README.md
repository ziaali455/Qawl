## Pushing Code (effective 2025)

PRs into dev require code reviews by **at least two engineers** your senior. Each new branch must be named with the format `firstname/feature-branch-name`. The process is simple: push to your branch, get reviewed, push to dev. If it gets approved by the App Store, it'll go to prod. 

When a new feature is pushed to prod that is over 200 lines of code, **it has to be documented** in the `docs/` folder before it gets into prod. Any AI documentation must be labeled as such. Attempts to push to prod without documentation will be **rejected** in code review. 

_This repo is now primarily managed by Musa._
